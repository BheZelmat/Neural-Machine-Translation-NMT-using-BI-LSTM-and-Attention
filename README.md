This repository contains a comprehensive guide and implementation for building an English-to-Portuguese Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with an attention mechanism. The document covers the end-to-end process, including data preparation, model building, training, and inference.

## Overview
The NMT model aims to translate sentences from English to Portuguese, leveraging the capabilities of LSTM networks and enhancing them with an attention mechanism to improve translation quality, especially for longer sentences.

## Contents

* Introduction and Background: Provides an overview of NMT and its significance, introducing LSTM and attention mechanisms.

* Data Preparation: Details the steps involved in preparing the dataset for training, including cleaning, tokenization, and splitting.

* Model Building: Describes the architecture of the NMT model, including the encoder-decoder framework and the incorporation of attention.

* Training: Explains the training process, loss computation, and evaluation metrics.

* Inference: Covers how to use the trained model to translate new sentences and discusses different decoding strategies, including greedy and Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding.

* Sample Outputs: Presents example translations generated by the model to demonstrate its performance.

* Conclusion: Summarizes key takeaways and potential areas for future improvement.
